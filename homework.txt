This is homework for git.
1. Copy and paste "homework.txt" into the same folder with different name. (Ex: homework_rename)
2. Open the renamed file and replace "bXXXXXXXX" with your own student ID number at below where says "\\change here".
3. Type your name at the end of the colon, then exit and save changes.
4. Rename the file to your student ID. (Ex: b00000001. You won't get any points if you don't do this step correctly!)
3. Create a folder with your own student ID in "hw_submission" folder, then put your homework file into the folder you created.
